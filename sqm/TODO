0. Finish rework of basic accuracy metrics

1. Single attribute utility functions:  if a value is passed in that exceeds the zrange, throw an error?  warning? what?
2. Contour or surface plots for maUtil objects?
4. Gather code for all the SA util methods into a single file for easier management
5. Finish LICENSE file (citation of SQM paper)
6. Parallelization and grouping for calcFidelity.  default arg for groupVars = NULL, thus with a possibility to not group at all.
7. Revisit the error message in confusion()--do we really need that constraint?
