
cjr package record of changes


2009.09.22
  Finalized CJR version used to test against VSP

2009.11.13   
  Added 'prior.pct.clean' to the items returned by find.n2() and find.n2.viable()

2010.01.06
  Added back the older 'find.n2.initial' and 'probRemain' so that we could still have the original CJR model of theta and theta/r.  Added back in the relevant arguments to 'cjrParms' to support 'find.n2.initial' and 'probRemain'.

2010.03.03
  Added the 'n2.0.viable' to the list output of n2.vs.viable.lambda().  The n2 sequence that is processed by n2.viable.lambda() is now log-linear.  And a smooth out the machine error, round(. , 14) was included in the diff() to verify whether lambda was non-increasing or not.

2010.03.10
  Modified 'n2.vs.viable.lambda' to exclude the 'flat-line' portion of the n2 vs. viable.lambda profile, added 'max.vl.diff' to the list of output.

2010.03.13
  Modified 'n2.vs.viable.lambda' to have a fixed minmum sequence length of 5000, and 'minimum.viable.lambda' was altered to have a default lambda sequence of size 50 with increments of 5e-07.  Added 'decimal precision' argument to 'find.n2.viable' and 'find.n2,' correctly used the precision in the first call to 'find.n2.viable' in 'n2.vs.viable.lambda'.

2010.03.16
  Added 'print.deviations' argument to 'n2.vs.viable.lambda'.  Flatline profiles from 'n2.vs.viable.lambda' now return summary info from 'minimum.viable.lambda' (instead of NA's).  Added 'num.not.viable' and 'seq.length' to the output list of 'minimum.viable.lambda'. 

2010.03.18
  Added 'n2.vs.viable.lambda.1' which does not run 'minimum.viable.lambda' when the viable.lambda for a particular n2 is equal to the target.lambda--but it also tests the entire sequence of 'n2' values (does not quit when the function flatlines).  Added the 'lambda.seq.length' argument to 'n2.vs.viable.lambda'.

2010.06.30
  Added 'gCalcConf', a function to simulate the confidence under the generalized CJR approach for the purpose of sensitivity studies for misspecification of prior parameters and number/location of judgmental samples.

2010.08.17
  Revised (simplified) is.viable.lambda() and find.viable.lambda() to use the results from the viable lambda theorem.  Backwards compatibility should be preserved, though at the expense of extra (and now deprecated) arguments.

2010.08.31
  Added calcConf.discrete() and 'discrete' argument to calcConf(), find.n2() and find.n2.viable().  This causes (1-lambda)*N to be rounded down to the nearest integer.

Version 0.2.0:  2014.09.22
  Added calcConf.fnr(), function for calculating the cjr confidence when the false negative rate is > 0
