#### pnlStat

A collection of miscellaneous functions suited to the PNNL environment

Virtually all of the functions that were once in `pnlStat` now reside in [Smisc](http://github.com/pnnl/Smisc). 
All that remain are a handful of PNNL-centric functions that may (or may not) be used in legacy code.
