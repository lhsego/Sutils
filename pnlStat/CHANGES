Version 0.1.1, 25 September 2014

Added the localCRANoptions() function to set options pertinent to PNNL prior to 
calling functions in the localCRAN package.

Version 0.1.0, 07 Aug 2014

Most of the functions in pnlStat were pushed to the Smisc package, which will be 
submitted to CRAN.

The only functions that remain are those they are PNNL-centric and perhaps not
suited for general use.  Since Smisc is a dependency of pnlStat, all the pnlStat 
functionality should remain intact.  One notable exception is that piclapply() 
is moving to the picRutils package.
