  Beta Quantile-Quantile plot
}
\description{
  %%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
  \code{qqbeta} is a function which produces a beta QQ plot for
  empirical data against a fitted beta distribution. 95\% confidence
  bands are produced based on the Komogorov-Smirnov GOF statistic.

\usage{
qqbeta(X, theta)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{X}{
    %%     ~~Describe \code{X} here~~
    The data hypothesized to be generated by a Beta distribution.
}
  \item{theta}{
    %%     ~~Describe \code{theta} here~~
    Parameters of the hypothesized Beta distribution.
}
}
\details{
  %%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
  Currently, the function is only able to produce 95\% confidence bands.
